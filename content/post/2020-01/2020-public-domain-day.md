In addition to the customary "Happy New Year" we casually wish each other, the first of January also ushers in a new round of creative works entering the [public domain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_domain) around the world. In Canada, it's works authored by contributors who died in 1969; in the EU it's works authored by contributors who died in 1949; and in the US it's works published in 1924.

One of the more prominent works entering the public domain from the US side is George Gershwin's [*Rhapsody in Blue*](https://imslp.org/wiki/Rhapsody_in_Blue_(Gershwin%2C_George)), first published in 1924 in its version for two pianos.

What this effectively means is that, as of January first, anyone is able to re-use or adapt Gershwin's most famous work without the consent (or application of license fee) of the publisher (New World Music). Although 2020 is a big year, the most significant was 2019 as it was the [first year since](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2018/04/copywritten-so-dont-copy-me/557420/) a massive freeze ended in the US.

For exploration of more public domain pieces, [Vice has a good article](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/akwd7b/best-of-public-domain-day-2020).
