Well, today was the first full day at VMworld 2017 in Las Vegas for all attendees. The prior two days were just for partners and known as Partner Exchange. But today was the first full regular day that included a general session for all attendees. Let me summarize the key points for our readers out there who aren’t with us in Vegas.

* VMware Cloud on Amazon Web Services:  At long last, the [solution](https://cloud.vmware.com/vmc-aws), which was announced last October, has finally come into general availability. Only one region is supported at this time, and that is in Oregon, but others will follow shortly with global availability planned. Check the link to view the page they have setup with full details. This is a pretty exciting announcement as it enables customers to adopt AWS without having to re-skill or re-tool on a new cloud platform—it’s just vSphere running in someone else’s datacenter. The full press release can be found [here](https://www.vmware.com/company/news/releases/vmw-newsfeed.VMware-Transforms-Security-for-Applications-Running-on-VMware-vSphere-Based-Virtualized-and-Cloud-Environments.2184703.html).

* NSX-T 2.0:  [NSX-T 2.0 was announced](https://blogs.vmware.com/networkvirtualization/2017/08/nsx-t-2-0.html/) today, which is the networking platform for VMware for multi-cloud and multi-hypervisor workloads. This is also the product which provides networking services in a containerized environment.

* Workspace ONE on HP:  HP’s Device-as-a-Service (DaaS) offering is now getting integration with Workspace ONE as announced today. The technology, based on AirWatch UEM, is able to manage and monitor endpoints and has been available for other systems for some time.

* VMware Cloud Foundation 2.2:  VCF 2.2 was [released](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Cloud-Foundation/2.2/rn/VMware-Cloud-Foundation-22-Release-Notes.html) which brings support for the latest VMware versions. This product allows instantiation of an entire SDDC in one fell swoop and has provisions for full lifecycle management including things like upgrading the stack.

* VMware Cloud Services:  Similar to the VMware Cloud on AWS announcement is a further broadened portfolio of [cloud services](https://cloud.vmware.com/) which includes things like the recent acquisition of [Wavefront](https://www.wavefront.com/).

* VMware AppDefense:  An interesting new solution which was [announced](https://www.vmware.com/company/news/releases/vmw-newsfeed.VMware-Transforms-Security-for-Applications-Running-on-VMware-vSphere-Based-Virtualized-and-Cloud-Environments.2184703.html) is similar to NSX’s ability to microsegment at the network layer, but this product does it at the compute layer. Here’s another [article from CRN](http://www.crn.com/news/cloud/300091226/vmware-takes-aim-at-hackers-with-appdefense-brings-security-to-the-virtualization-networking-layers.htm) covering this news.
