      <description>In addition to the customary &amp;ldquo;Happy New Year&amp;rdquo; we casually wish each other, the first of January also ushers in a new round of creative works entering the public domain around the world. In Canada, it&amp;rsquo;s works authored by contributors who died in 1969; in the EU it&amp;rsquo;s works authored by contributors who died in 1949; and in the US it&amp;rsquo;s works published in 1924.
One of the more prominent works entering the public domain from the US side is George Gershwin&amp;rsquo;s Rhapsody in Blue, first published in 1924 in its version for two pianos.</description>
