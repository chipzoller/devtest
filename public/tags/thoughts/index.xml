      <description>As long as I’ve been involved in technology, I’ve noticed a central theme which reappears countless times and is a powerful influencer in every decision, hire, and discussion. This theme invisibly steers businesses in meaningful ways yet isn&amp;rsquo;t given enough serious thought by developers and technical folks. That theme, or question rather, is whether to build or buy. In other words, &amp;ldquo;do we build this thing ourselves or do we buy a thing from someone else?</description>

      <description>In addition to the customary &amp;ldquo;Happy New Year&amp;rdquo; we casually wish each other, the first of January also ushers in a new round of creative works entering the public domain around the world. In Canada, it&amp;rsquo;s works authored by contributors who died in 1969; in the EU it&amp;rsquo;s works authored by contributors who died in 1949; and in the US it&amp;rsquo;s works published in 1924.
One of the more prominent works entering the public domain from the US side is George Gershwin&amp;rsquo;s Rhapsody in Blue, first published in 1924 in its version for two pianos.</description>
